This is a prototype for Pokemon Utility software. The idea is to create a one-stop program that provides information for anything from a Pokemon's base stats to breeding information to a shiny counter.

The inspiration for this program is the Android app MTGFamiliar, which is essentially an all-in-one utility for Magic: The Gathering.
